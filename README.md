# Moka Board
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Prerequisites

```shell
$ zsh < <(curl -s -S -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moovweb/gvm/master/binscripts/gvm-installer)
```

Install Go v1.14.1 using GVM
```shell
$ gvm install go1.14.1 -B
```

Update Bash/Zsh
```shell
$ open -e ~/.zshrc
```

Update it with:
```shell
export GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP=$GOROOT
export GO111MODULE=auto
```

## Installing
Default GO verision
```shell
$ gvm use go1.14.1 --default
```

Running with VsCode, just put the launch.json. Then tun by Click `Run` on VsCode.
```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Debug Staging",
      "type": "go",
      "request": "launch",
      "mode": "debug",
      "program": "${workspaceRoot}",
      "envFile": "${workspaceFolder}/.env",
      "args": []
    }
  ]
}
```

Running with Terminal
```shell
$ 
  export JURNAL_MOKA_DB_USERNAME=FILL_THIS_VALUE;
  export JURNAL_MOKA_DB_PASSWORD=FILL_THIS_VALUE;
  export JURNAL_MOKA_DB_HOST=FILL_THIS_VALUE;
  export JURNAL_MOKA_DB_PORT=FILL_THIS_VALUE;
  export JURNAL_MOKA_DB_NAME=FILL_THIS_VALUE;
  export BASE_URL_OLD_FE=FILL_THIS_VALUE;
  export BASE_URL_NEW_FE=FILL_THIS_VALUE;

$ go run main.go
```

## Running the Linter
